## 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm **StupidityNoob**, your friendly neighborhood lazy scripter.  
I make random Roblox scripts, mess around with ideas, and sometimes create something that **actually**
works.

---

## ⚙️ What I Do
- 🧩 **Roblox Lua Scripting** – Rayfield GUIs, ESPs **Weird Experiment**
- 🎮 **Game Tweaks** – Automation, quality-of-life scripts, and utilities  
- 🧠 **Testing & Debugging** – Aka *spamming print() until it works*

## 🧰 Tools & Tech
`Lua` • `Rayfield` • `GitHub` • `Coffee`
